  Add RPM spec file dependency on python-setuptools

  At least in SLES 11 SP2, the pkg_resources module is only available if
  the python-setuptools RPM has been installed. In newer openSUSE
  versions, installation python-distribute will satisfy this dependency as
  well.

  (Git commit c20a48f8978fa4cfee9b0a3e0acc9e9ce8a4c705)

  Export module's version as obtained from setuptools to enable version
  checks

  Seeing that python-netsnmpagent keeps gaining features in newer
  versions, I thought that it makes sense to make its version number
  available for version checks in agent code. Especially since some
  changes such as those to logging behavior in 61e9c4aa can not really be
  tested for.

  (Git commit c77f52aaa00fa41352406f9410e61813eefc0183)

* Sun Oct 27 17:44:06 2013 +0100 - Pieter Hollants <pieter@hollants.com>

  Distinguish connect failure between first attempt and reconnecting

  On the one hand, it does not make sense to BOTH raise a
  netsnmpAgentException for connection failure that will undoubtedly be
  printed to stderr or logged in some kind of way by agents AND pass on
  net-snmp's "Warning" log message to be printed/logged as well.

  On the other hand, we can not unconditionally intercept and surpress the
  "Warning" log message as there is not only the scenario of connection
  failure at startup but also when we got disconnected by the AgentX
  master. In the latter case we would get and print/log an "Info" log
  message that we were disconnected and net-snmp will retry in, say, 15
  seconds and another "Info" when we'd be connected again, but see no log
  message for ongoing connection failure.

  Thus, this change reworks the netsnmpAgentStatus cases to move away from
  a generic DISCONNECTED status to two distinguished FIRSTCONNECT and
  RECONNECTING cases: the connection failure log message will be
  surpressed and an exception be raised in the FIRSTCONNECT state only.

  And while we're at it, ECONNECT was inspired by <errno.h>, of course,
  but as I can't imagine other EWHATEVER conditions, I felt CONNECTFAILED
  to be a more self-explainatory name.

* Sun Oct 27 13:59:18 2013 +0100 - Pieter Hollants <pieter@hollants.com>

  Explicitly document the possible "msgprio" strings

  As client code might opt to not just print/log the priority but apply 
  filtering to it.

  (Git commit b9ec11a51a7f89e5cde301a11514f55c2ed894d5)

* Sun Oct 27 13:56:59 2013 +0100 - Pieter Hollants <pieter@hollants.com>

  Write out priority levels LOG_EMERG as "Emergency" and LOG_CRIT as
  "Critical"

  Since we most probably write these to stderr or a logfile, they should
  be verbose and unambiguous enough for the user.

  (Git commit 1fdcf5637cbab1c2ea548b9377edc7c548cdc24d)

* Sun Oct 27 12:48:58 2013 +0100 - Pieter Hollants <pieter@hollants.com>

  Add support for custom log handlers

  Change b68a9775 implemented detection of connection establishment and
  failure by accessing the log messages net-snmp generates. Log messages
  were still printed to stderr.

  This change allows agents using python-netsnmpagent to define their own 
  custom log handler function by setting the new "LogHandler" property
  when creating the "netsnmpAgent" object. The function will then be
  called whenever the net-snmp code generates a log message with two
  parameters: 1. a string describing the message's priority 2. the text of
  the message itself

  If "LogHandler" is None, error message will continue to be printed to
  stderr, as can be seen in simple_agent.py. Whereas threading_agent.py,
  being a step towards a more real-life agent, has been updated to use a
  custom "LogHandler" to integrate net-snmp messages in its output more
  nicely.

  In your own agents, you will instead most likely define a custom log
  handler to write the messages to your agent's logfile.

  (Git commit f14b919664b7418ed56e0cd3fdf86531501c7c64)

* Fri Oct 25 18:31:58 2013 +0200 - Pieter Hollants <pieter@hollants.com>

  Support detecting connection establishment/failure

  So far we just relied on net-snmp resp. its init_snmp() function to
  establish the AgentX connection to the master snmpd instance and neither
  knew nor cared about whether a connection could be established at all. A
  mistake in the
  "MasterSocket" option would only cause a warning on stderr, emitted by
  net-snmp itself, only. Likewise, indication of a successful connection
  was through log messages on stderr only, too.

  This change introduces support for explicit detection of connection 
  establishment and failure. To this end, the netsnmpAgent class' internal
  "_started" flag was replaced with a "_status" property that can take on
  the values defined in the new "netsnmpAgentStatus" enumeration. Your
  code should however NOT access this property -- just make sure to catch
  the new netsnmpAgentExceptions (implemented in the example agents in
  cd4ee23b).

  The change is quite large due to the fact that net-snmp itself in
  neither the 5.4.x nor 5.7.x versions actually returns status
  information: init_snmp() is defined as "void", lending due to the fact
  that it will actually trigger a sequence of function calls including
  callback functions that return "void" themselves. Unfortunately there is
  also no dedicated callback mechanism for client code such as
  python-netsnmpagent that gets called on connection status changes. So we
  had to invent it on our own, using two callback functions as more or
  less ugly workarounds: a custom log handler and, for net-snmp 5.4.x
  support, another callback function that abuses a callback hook
  originally intended for different purposes. See the sources for details, 
  they are well commented.

  In this version, our custom log handler writes all log messages it
  receives to stderr, resembling previous behavior with the difference
  that we also log a message's priority level as defined by net-snmp, eg.
  "[Info] Foo.".

* Thu Oct 24 18:05:54 2013 +0200 - Pieter Hollants <pieter@hollants.com>

  Add support for catching netsnmpAgentException in example agents

  Up to now netsnmpAgent objects were created and their start() methods
  called without any error handling. But an upcoming change will introduce
  a new netsnmpAgentException that will be raised for error conditions, so
  the example agents need to know about them.

  (Git commit 436d754db8afbc4e728e5903b155cdefa38ddb6e)

* Thu Oct 24 15:17:01 2013 +0200 - Pieter Hollants <pieter@hollants.com>

  Explicitly advertise simple_agent.py's support for state dumping with
  SIGHUP

  Sending simple_agent.py a SIGHUP signal causes its current variable
  state to be dumped again. This is worth a more explicit advertising at
  agent startup.

  (Git commit 26f971fe48a50b629a5cad57a6f0a8f47811e20d)

* Fri Oct 25 19:23:05 2013 +0200 - Pieter Hollants <pieter@hollants.com>

Changes from v0.4.5 to v0.4.6
=============================

* Thu Oct 17 22:02:12 2013 +0200 - Pieter Hollants <pieter@hollants.com>

  Advertise support for alternative AgentX transports more explicitly

  We did already support alternative transports for the AgentX
  communication between subagents and master snmpd instances, that is, not
  just UNIX domain sockets but eg. also TCP ports. These are specified
  through transport specifications that follow the format described in the
  "LISTENING ADDRESSES" section in the snmpd(8) manpage.

  This change modifies wording that would suggest we supported alternative 
  UNIX domain socket paths only. It also adds a new script to run
  simple_agent.py against a snmpd instance over a TCP port, surprisingly
  named
  "run_simple_agent_over_tcpsocket.sh".

  Use WATCHER_MAX_SIZE instead of WATCHER_SIZE_STRLEN for 5.4.x
  compatibility

  We used to rely on net-snmp >= 5.5 behavior by setting a
  WATCHER_SIZE_STRLEN flag that didn't exist in net-snmp 5.4.x yet. For
  backwards compatibility we now use WATCHER_MAX_SIZE and update the used
  netsnmp_watcher_info structure's
  "data_size" field ourselves.

  Deref watcher before trying to its max_size property

  The netsnmp_watcher_info structure returned by
  netsnmp_create_watcher_info is a pointer, so it must be de-referenced
  with ctypes' "contents" attribute before any of its properties can be
  set.

  Add missing netsnmp_watcher_info fields definition to netsnmpapi

  Basically we do not need fields definitions for net-snmp structures that
  we never modify ourselves. However in this case we actually tried
  setting netsnmp_watcher_info's "max_size" field which resulted in a
  no-op.

  New example threading_agent.py demonstrating asynchronous data updates

  The default simple_agent.py always blocked until certain events occured,
  eg. SNMP requests had to be processed, and only updated its SNMP objects 
  inbetween. Also SNMP requests couldn't be handled while data was in the 
  process of being updated. Thus here's a more real life-usable example
  that outsources data updating into a separate thread. It does however
  not address possible locking issues.

  Automatically generate %changelog section for RPM spec file

  The spec file uses a different changelog style than the ChangeLog file,
  which would be too verbose for this purpose. Usually package maintainers
  note changes to the spec file itself here as well and often give a more
  high-level summary of changes of the software being packaged. Our
  automatically generated changelog will not be of the same quality as we
  only indicate the timestamps a version was tagged and an "Update to
  version x.y.z"-style message. But until now we didn't use the ChangeLog
  section at all. And package maintainers can still replace it with a more
  detailed, manually maintained version.

  the generated dist/python-netsnmpagent.spec along with the source
  archive and simply copy it some build host and build.

  Replace hardcoded version number with latest Git tag

  With this change, the version number is no longer hard-coded inside
  setup.py. Instead, the version number is derived from the latest git tag
  using "git describe". The Makefile (which is now more than a pure
  convenience Makefile) will generate setup.py from setup.py.in
  (which has been renamed accordingly), so that a source distribution
  (.tar.gz) will have the correct version number inside.

  As a special rule, whenever the Git checkout is not at a tag, "git
  describe" will generate a string similar to "0.2-21-g0e10fca",
  indicating that there have been 21 commits since the last tag "0.2" and
  the latest commit is g0e10fca. We translate this to
  "0.2_next21_g0e10fca" so a.) RPM does not complain about the dashes (it
  doesn't allow them in its "Version" field) and b.) the "next" indicates
  that this is a forthcoming version.

  API change: swap "oidstr" and "initval" arguments for scalar variables

  The function signature for create_vartype_class() has changed and as
  such the constructor method signature for all classes using the
  @VarTypeClass decorator, that is, all classes representing SNMP scalar
  variables, eg. Integer32(), Unsigned32() etc. "initval" now comes first
  so that in scenarios where we just a SNMP variable without the intent of 
  registering it we can simply write

    agent.Integer32(20)

  instead of

    agent.Integer32(initval=20)

  which, of course, implies "oidstr" == None. The former construct is of
  much more use when being interpreted as "initval" instead of "oidstr" as
  in

    agent.Integer32("EXAMPLE-MIB::exampleInteger32")

  which continues requiring an "oidstr=" prefix to work.

  This means that if you have already written agents using
  python-netsnmpagent and you did not follow the style in example_agent.py
  with explicit "initval=" and "oidstr=" qualifiers, you WILL have to
  adapt your code.

  Abstract certain functions from actual library for compatibility with
  net-snmp <5.6

  From net-snmp 5.5 to 5.6, all code from libnetsnmphelpers.so got
  integrated into libnetsnmpagent.so. While this doesn't break C programs
  since ld-linux.so will take care of dynamically resolving referenced
  symbols, with ctypes all prototype definitions and functions calls
  always depend on a particular libX handle.

  Therefore we now test using netsnmp_create_watcher_info whether that
  function is available in libnetsnmpagent and fall back to
  libnetsnmphelpers otherwise. The remaining code now uses libnsX to
  abstract from the actual library used.

  Support auto-update of row counter variable for tables

  A SNMP variable of an integer type can be created and passed in to the

  First implementation of table support

  Among the existing scalar variables, netsnmpagent now supports SNMP
  tables. Table objects are defined in terms of the types of the row
  indexes, the number of columns, their types and their default row values
  and whether they are extendable or not (ie. whether new rows can be
  added through snmpset). After creation (and registration), rows can be
  added and individual cell contents set.

  This implementation does not support the value() method for tables yet.

  Use a string index type for the exampleTable

  In preparation for the upcoming table support, the index type for
  exampleTable (exampleTableIndex) was changed to a string type since
  it'll make for a more advanced example than an integer type.

  Move net-snmp API stuff into own file and define C function prototypes

  Everything ctypes and libnetsnmpagent-related has been moved into the
  new file netsnmpapi.py that gets imported by netsnmpagent.py. All
  netsnmp functions called are now also defined in terms of argument and
  result types, similar to C prototypes. To achieve this, the
  libnetsnmpagent handle is now defined globally instead of being part of
  the netsnmpAgent class.

  Reunify SNMP object creation and registration again

  It turned out to be unnecessarily complex to maintain consistency with
  the seperation of SNMP object creation and registration as introduced in
  0f7a4cdbf4677ebae52e0abee2acacd148c50491. Yet, that change is not
  literally undone:
  - Registration of an SNMP object must now be specified at object
  creation time by passing an "oidstr", if desired. If left off, the
  return object will remain unbound to the MIB and can be used mostly for
  object property inspection. As a consequence, register() was removed
  again. The new "writable" parameter to the object's creation method
  replaces register()'s "allow_set".
  - Previously, objects were created and if register() was called on them,
  it called a defined callback method. Now, the object's creation method
  calls the renamed _prepareRegistration() method instead and incorporates
  _registerWatcher() functionality.
  - The variable type's props array no longer needs a "register_func"
  member.

  Generalize for SNMP tables, separate SNMP object creation and
  registration

  This change generalizes netsnmpagent in that we now deal with "SNMP
  objects" instead of just SNMP variables. This is in preparation of the
  upcoming support of SNMP tables.

  Because of the semantics associated with how we will wrap tables, SNMP
  object creation and registration under a certain OID are now separate
  tasks. SNMP objects now must be explicitly registered (see
  example_agent.py).

  Further details of the changes:
  - Because registering a certain SNMP object is object-dependent, the
  VarTypeClass() decorator now expects a new member "register_func" that
  specifies the callback function that will be called by the new generic
  register() method.
  - register() incorporates the former oidstr2oid() method
  - The VarTypeClass() decorator's variable registration code went into
  register() and the new callback function _registerWatcher() as well.
  - Variable type class instances now possess most of the atttributes from
  their props[] array such as "asntype" and "flags"
  - _data_size and _max_size were not always set correctly
  - Variable type class instances now possess a new cref() method which
  always returns the correct pointer to the enclosed _cvar, depending on
  the variable type

  Add run_example_agent.sh script to make running example_agent.py easier

  example_agent.py has now learned two command line options:
  -m/--master-socket allows specifying the Unix domain socket that
  python-netsnmpagent will use to connect to the master snmpd agent and
  speak AgentX. -p/--persistent-dir is passed on the net-snmp library and
  sets the directory the library will use to store persistance
  information.

  Both parameters are used by the new run_example_agent.sh script to be
  able to setup a net-snmp instance running under the current user and
  independent from a eventually running system-level snmpd service. They
  will also be used by upcoming automatic tests.

  run_example_agent takes care of
  - creating a temporary directory
  - creating a minimal snmpd configuration that especially places all
  system file/directory references into the temporary directory instead
  - running snmpd with additional necessary parameters
  - giving the user guidance as to the right net-snmp CLI utility commands
  - running example_agent.py with suitable parameters
  - cleanup of the temporary dir upon exit

  Use single C variable reference and mutable string buffer

  String handling was broken. We must use ctypes.create_string_buffer with
  a defined MAX_STR_SIZE instead of ctypes.c_char_p because the latter
  creates a buffer which a.) Python considered immutable while "snmpset"
  would happily write into it and b.) had an implicit maximum size
  depending on the initial creation string, causing possible memory
  corruption when "snmpset" would be used with a larger string.

  It also didn't make much sense to re-create a new ctypes.* instance upon
  each SNMP variable update from within the Python agent, because the
  integer types were mutable before and strings have become so.

  We fill out netsnmp_watcher_info's "max_size" properly now. Required for
  string types.

  Also discarded the special handling for strings, special handling now
  depends on props["flags"] only.

  Reordered things in define_and_register() and accordingly renamed it to
  register_and_define().

  Added more verbose comments about the process of SNMP variable
  registration.

  Implement special handling for c_char_p variable types more explicitly

  We need a special case distinction for c_char_p (char *) variables
  during variable creation anyway (doesn't use ctypes.byref()), so no need
  for props["flags"], which was different for c_char_p only.

  Also fix watcher info's max_size as 0 as it is only used if the
  WATCHER_MAX_SIZE flag is set which we don't use.

  Streamline SNMP variable class definition

  Before, there was a netsnmpVariable class and Integer32, Unsigned32,
  DisplayString32 etc. classes deriving from it (and an intermediate class
  netsnmpIntegerVariable). The variables carried the SNMP registration
  intelligence. In addition, netsnmpAgent had an addVar() method and proxy
  methods named liked the classes, taking care of creating variable
  instance and adding them to an agent's internal variable registry.

  Now, netsnmpAgent features a VarTypeClass decorator method that gets
  applied to methods Integer32, Unsigned32, DisplayString32 etc. which do
  nothing but return a dictionary with variable type properties. The
  decorator transforms these functions so that they a.) define the
  suitable class b.) create an instance and c.) register that instance
  with net-snmp. The classes themselves are now nothing but wrappers for
  the ctypes variables. So the registration intelligence (and
  oidstr2oid()) is back in netsnmpAgent itself again.-

  Major rewrite of SNMP variable handling and exposed API

  Before, the code using the module (eg. example.py) had to own
  ctypes-style variables and deal with conversions etc. netsnmpAgent just
  provided a registration function.

  Now, netsnmpAgent offers methods that return classes inheriting from a
  base class, netsnmpVariable, one class for each variable type. Class
  creation requires specification of the OID to register for and
  indication whether the variable should be writable using SNMP requests.
  Each class obtained this way offers value() and update() methods, called
  by the client at its decretion. See example.py how much shorter and
  nicer this looks.

  The interface is not quite polished yet, currently netsnmpVariable and
  deriving classes share the same namespace as netsnmpAgent and require an
  "agentlib" argument to get access to netsnmpAgent's libnetsnmpagent
  handle. This is currently provided by an addVar method for which there
  are in turn wrapper functions named after each variable type. This could
  need some improvement, probably using a factory method and/or
  decorators.

  In other news:
  - Moved net-snmp constants to the module level to avoid accessibility
  problems from within the new netsnmpVariable class and inheriting
  classes.
  - Removed debug-style print statement that spit out the name of each
  loaded MIB upon agent startup
  - Simplified library loading code since it looks like libnetsnmpagent
  alone will suffice.
